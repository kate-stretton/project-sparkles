# Sparkle Canvas
Sparkle Canvas is a painting app built during week 4 of Dev Academy. Our goal was to get more comfortable with managing component state in React. 

Sparkle Canvas has been deployed on Heroku and can be found at https://sparkle-canvas.herokuapp.com/. Pick a colour and paint away. Double click to erase. If you've made too many mistakes, click 'Reset' to start over.
